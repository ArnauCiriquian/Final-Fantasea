# Final FantaSea
## My first ever developed video game, a tribute to the classic combat system of Final Fantasy, tailored for a simplified playthrough experience exclusively through the command line. Developed using JavaScript and Node.js, this homage allows players to engage in the immersive world of Final FantaSea's combat mechanics directly through the console interface.
